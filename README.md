# All Things Open 2016
## React Internals through the Lens of a Renderer

Demos for my React Internals talk at All Things Open 2016. Each folder has it’s
own package.json to install and run. From the root project you can run `./run.sh
{demo}` to run everything easily, otherwise `cd` in and run `npm install`.

The Hardware demo requires the install to take place with a node v4.x branch for
the moment maybe (I haven’t really tested it too much).

## Slides are available in the `./slides` directory. Note that the slides iframe
in the web, music, and aframe demos so having those running on ports 3001, 3002,
and 3003 accordingly will give you the real experience.
